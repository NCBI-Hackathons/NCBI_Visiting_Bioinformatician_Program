# NCBI Visiting Bioinformatician Program
Postdocs and Graduate Students Visit NCBI for 4 to 6 weeks for Training in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Data Science, Project Management and Product Management

## Project Highlights

```
VBs will place links to their repos and other product deliverables here

#### PubRunner

A framework for keeping text mining up-to-date. Many text mining tools and results become stale because they aren't updated with the latest publications. This framework manages the download of required corpora (e.g. PubMed), execution of tools, uploading results to somewhere public and updating the status of the tool on the PubRunner website. The VB program is being used to productize PubRunner and create a flexible and easy-to-use Python package.

#### AutoDenovo

Pipeline for finding denovo mutations related to neurodevelopmental disorders using family study designs, similar to pipelines previously developed for cancer research. It combines different types of variants by multiple callers, and uses both chip and exome sequencing data. The end goal is to compare annotated variants to public databases (dbVar, ClinVar), possibly indicating further sequencing or mechanistic avenues.

#### Polygenic SNP Search Tool (PSST)
Pipeline that identifies multiple SNPs that are associated with diseases or disease phenotypes. This pipeline identifies
asserted pathogenic SNPs. in addition, the pipeline uses SNPs identified in Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS), crossed with databases such as ClinVar and dbSNP to construct a report describing multiple genetic variants associated with diseases.

## Training Objectives for the Visiting Bioinformatician Program

### Bioinformatics
  While most visitors are already bioinformaticians in some capacity, novel data types and datasets are explored, typically from public datasets.  
### Computational Biology
  Statistical methods and data visualization are also explored 
### Data Science
  Visitors typically work with streaming data, instead of localized datasets
### Project Management
  Typically, visitors are put in charge of a team of bioinformaticians during the last week of their stay at NCBI.  
### Product Management
  Visitors leverage their own use cases, the use cases of their colleagues, and reach out to others in government, academia and industry to find other suitable use cases for their bioinformatics products.  
### Communication
  For the most part, coding and research are done live -- primarily on github -- which is a distinct departure from antiquated scientific communication practices.
